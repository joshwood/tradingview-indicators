# tradingview-indicators

## TripleSuperTrend


Apologies - 100% derived from [KivancOzbilgic](https://www.tradingview.com/u/KivancOzbilgic/). 

New to the tradingview script community, not sure the best way to site [sources](https://www.tradingview.com/script/r6dAP7yi/).

After watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohv3Hs94lNU)
I wanted to combine 3 supertrend indicators into one because I'm too cheap to pay for tradingview. I set the defaults based on the video.

It's my first attempt at pinescript - not beautiful
